# Project Context

## What is This Book About?
This textbook teaches students how to build AI-powered humanoid robots that can:
- Walk and balance like humans
- See and understand their environment
- Listen to voice commands
- Make intelligent decisions
- Perform physical tasks

## Why Does This Matter?
Humanoid robots are the future of:
- Elder care and healthcare
- Warehouse automation
- Service industry
- Disaster response
- Home assistance

## Course Integration
This book is designed for a 13-week university course where students:
1. Start with robot control basics (ROS 2)
2. Learn to simulate robots (Gazebo/Unity)
3. Add AI perception (NVIDIA Isaac)
4. Integrate language models (GPT-4, Whisper)
5. Build a complete autonomous humanoid in final project

## Student Prerequisites
- Basic Python programming
- Understanding of AI/ML concepts
- Familiarity with Linux terminal
- (No prior robotics knowledge required)

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this book, students will be able to:
1. Design robot control systems using ROS 2
2. Simulate robots in realistic environments
3. Implement computer vision and SLAM
4. Integrate LLMs for robot decision-making
5. Deploy complete autonomous systems

## Industry Relevance
Technologies taught align with what companies like:
- Tesla (Optimus humanoid)
- Boston Dynamics (Atlas)
- Figure AI
- 1X Technologies
...are currently using in production.
