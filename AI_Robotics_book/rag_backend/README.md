# RAG Search Backend

This directory is intended for the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) search backend for the textbook content.

## Conceptual Role

The RAG backend will enable users to query the textbook content using natural language and receive contextually relevant answers generated by an LLM. It will work by:
1.  **Indexing**: Processing all Markdown chapters from the `docs/` directory and storing them in a searchable format (e.g., vector database).
2.  **Retrieval**: When a user submits a query, it will retrieve the most relevant chunks of text from the indexed content.
3.  **Augmentation**: These retrieved chunks will be used as context to augment a prompt sent to a Large Language Model.
4.  **Generation**: The LLM will then generate a coherent and informative answer based on the user's query and the provided context.

## Implementation Details (High-Level)

-   **Framework**: Potentially LangChain, LlamaIndex, or a custom Python solution.
-   **Vector Database**: ChromaDB, FAISS, Pinecone, or similar.
-   **LLM Integration**: OpenAI API, Hugging Face models, or local models.
-   **API Endpoint**: A simple REST API (e.g., using FastAPI or Flask) to expose the search functionality.

## Placeholder File

-   `rag_backend.py`: A placeholder script to illustrate the entry point for the RAG backend. Actual implementation would be much more extensive.
