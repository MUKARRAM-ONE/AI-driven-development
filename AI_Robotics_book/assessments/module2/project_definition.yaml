# Project Definition for Module 2 Assessment: Gazebo Joint Control

# Expected ROS 2 Interfaces for the student's node
# Student's node is expected to publish JointTrajectory messages
interfaces:
  publication:
    topic_name: "/joint_trajectory_controller/joint_trajectory"
    message_type: "trajectory_msgs/JointTrajectory"

# Assessment parameters for the simulated robot and target
assessment_params:
  robot_name: "test_robot"
  joint_to_control: "joint1"
  target_position: 0.5 # radians
  tolerance: 0.05 # radians
  time_to_reach_target: 5 # seconds

# Test cases for the auto-grader
test_cases:
  - name: "Test Case 1: Reach Target Position"
    description: "Verify that the specified joint reaches the target position."
    score: 100
    expected_outcome: "joint_at_target" # Custom outcome for grader logic

# Grading configuration
grading:
  timeout: 15 # seconds for entire assessment
  max_score: 100
